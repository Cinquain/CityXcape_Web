        <p>
            In January of 2020, I had done my first urbex mission. Together with a few other explorers, we scouted an abandoned Naval base in Mare Island, California. You can see the episode on this exploration here.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            Since then, I haven’t stopped urban exploring. I found an abandoned farm in Hawaii, an abandoned hospital on Staten Island, explored the abandoned Naval Air Station in New York, and many more.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            This article is not about my urbex missions however, we all have those. This article is about the needs the urbex app I built is currently facing. For those of you who don’t know, I am one of the two founders of CityXcape- the app to find secret spots.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            CityXcape keeps secret spots hidden by confining them to a world. Those of you who want to find abandoned places should join the urban explorer world when you sign up for CityXcape. Right now, CityXcape has abandoned places posted in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Detroit. But what about the rest of America? That's what the community needs your help.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            If you’re a seasoned urbexer, you likely know a few abandoned places. What I ask of you is that you share some of these abandoned places you know on CityXcape so that the urbex community can become more versatile. Urbexers will now have abandoned places to explore across several cities. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            But what do you get in return for sharing your well earned abandoned places? Since CityXcape is still in its early stages, the reward mechanisms are not fully in force yet but in the meantime, this is what you gain by posting some of your abandoned places on CityXcape. 1) You get to save all your abandoned places in a central location. 2) You contribute to the urbex community. 3) You get to enjoy the abandoned places other members have posted. 4) CityXcape will back pay you the streetcred you are owed for the abandoned places you share. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            In the future, the CityXcape app will connect you with other explorers who want to explore the same abandoned places as you do- that way you two or more people can do joint adventures. This feature is not yet completed but rest assured, it is well in progress. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            While William and I figure out the technical component, we need you to do your part by posting a few abandoned places in the city you call home. Our goal is to have at least 10 abandoned places in every city. Help us reach that goal by contributing to CityXcape.
