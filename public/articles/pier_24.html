            Today's secret spot is a gorgeous photography museum freely available to you. The museum is funded by the Pilara foundation. The organization is owned by a married couple who wish to share their street photography collection to the public at no charge.

            The entrance to this museum is rather hidden. You have to do a bit of searching to find it. But once you do, prepare for an absolute turn around. The check-in allows you to store your jacket or bag. Once signed in, you are free to roam around and enjoy state of the art photography.

            What I liked most about this building is the relaxed atmosphere. You can take photos and talk freely. No pretentious guard surveilling your every movement. The museum also has friendly volunteers that periodically walk around to answer questions you may have. Since the space is rather small, the experience feels intimate and people socialize. This secret spot is great for meeting people.
