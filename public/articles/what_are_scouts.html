            I have met scouts throughout my life. Over the years, I have gathered enough observations to express a solid description of who they are. Many people who are interested in urban exploring would like to know more about the community. They want to know what scouts are like, the type of scouting they can do, and why scouts are so important to the city. I will address all these questions in this article.

            Scouts come in all shapes and form. I’ve met scouts from all cultural backgrounds. They do have a look however. Experience has proven me that two styles tend to be predominant in the scout community. There is the edgy ‘outdoors look’ type of scout, and there is another with a modern streetwear appearance. As for myself, I definitely fall in the former, I love my boots and beanie!

            There are mainly four types of scouts. The ground scout, the food scout, the night scout, and the art scout. Since this isn’t an article covering the type of Scouts, I will not go into  details on what each does.

            Scouts hate staying in one place, but they love to explore new ones. Scouts hate being inside over long periods, but they love being outside in open air. Scouts hate routines, but they love breaking patterns. Many of them possess a keen knowledge of history and architecture. The most important trait however is that all scouts share a sincere love for the streets.

             Scouts find secret spots, that’s their duty. Although it might seem trivial, these secret spots are valuable to people in the city who long for genuine connection. The secret spots scouts find are shared with people via the CityXcape app.

            In exchange, scouts are rewarded by the community through street followers with the top ones framed in the city’s leaderboard. Does this sound like a job you would enjoy? If so, join our community by using the enlist button below.  Happy scouting!
