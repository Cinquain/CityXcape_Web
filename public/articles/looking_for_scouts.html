            When I lived in San Francisco, I developed the fun hobby of finding secret spots. For those who are unfamiliar, a secret spot is a hidden gem in the city. It can be a place of tremendous beauty, an intimate corner where you can bring that special someone, or just a free museum no one knows about.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            One day, I took a friend to a few of my secret spots. Impressed by the experience, he calmly remarked that I should build an app around this activity. I told him this was a stupid idea. Three years later… my co-founder William and I built CityXcape- the app to find secret spots. 
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            CityXcape has been out for more than a few months now, and the app is still finding its niche. One of the challenges CityXcape faces is getting more secret spots onboard its platform.
        </p>

            This is where you can help. If you are an explorer like myself, then you probably know plenty of cool spots unknown to others. If every explorer like yourself posts just a few secret spots on  CityXcape, then everyone (including you) will have new spots to visit.
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            I know that some of you are worried about sharing your secret spots. You don’t want people to ruin or vandalize it. After all, I’m an explorer too. I know how it feels when a secret spot becomes mainstream and ruined by obnoxious crowds. This is why CityXcape goes out of its way to keep secret spots visible only to the right people. The app does this by using a system of worlds. 
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            A world is a community with common values. Skaters, Surfers, Artists, Writers, etc. Those are all worlds that exist within a city. CityXcape keeps a secret spot visible within a world. Different worlds, different secret spots. This means that if a user is in the LBGT world, he or she will not see the secret spots of Skaters. 
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            The second way CityXcape keeps secret spots hidden is by not giving away its location until the user is close to it. What the CityXcape map shows instead are heat areas. The heat zones tell you what areas have secret spots. As the user approaches that heat area,  the secret spot is revealed. 
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            You explorers out there, all I ask is that you download the CityXcape app and post a few cool secret spots in your city. The world you should join is called Scout Life. It is a world for those who love to study and explore cities. The secret spots we cherish are free stuff, historical locations, beautiful lounges, nature getaways, and any other goodies people often ignore  allow you to escape from the city. 
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            Help me reach my goal of growing the Scout Life world into a community full of secret spots in every city. There should be at least 10 secret spots per city. The secret spots you post become someone else's exploration. The same works vice versa. Let’s all contribute and explore!
