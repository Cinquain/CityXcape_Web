            In the last episode, we covered how City X is a republic- which means a city governed by laws. City X also has no legislation, its laws emerge naturally, as people figure out what social patterns work over time. Lastly, City X has no legal monopoly. All services, from protection, to mass transit, to even money creation are opened to the creative energies of entrepreneurs. If you have not seen episode one, I highly recommend you doing so.         </p>

            A citizen of City X. Proud Entrepreneur and sovereign, like every other inhabitant.

            In the next episode, we will cover the concept of collective agreements. But before doing so however, I will address a question I frequently receive about City X. That question deals with voting. I have already mentioned that City X is not a democracy. It is not even a democratic republic like the United States, where officials are elected to write laws. The question then is, how do citizens of City X vote? There is not an answer to this question, rather, there is a clarification in regards to what voting is.        </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            Voting is not a ballot box. In fact, voting has very little to do with state politics. Voting is a wielding of power. Your true vote is how you spend your time and energy. In other words, your vote is what you give energy to.         
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            You vote when you buy a product. You vote when you spend time with someone. You vote with the kind of content you watch, etc. In fact, you can never stop voting. Since  action requires energy, every action you do is a vote. So the people of City X would be voting just fine. The only difference between them and you is that they would be aware of what a real vote is, human energy.         </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            One last thing! When you go to the ballot box and vote for a government official, the real thing you are voting for is NOT the politician. Politicians come and go. What you are voting for is the system. You are giving the system your energy. Think about that!         </p>
